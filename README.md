Hello,

Before you start check this project, you need to know in mine repository is Rock Paper Scissors game vol.1 and it's contain
a lot more of CSS, with animations, reponsivity etc. But the engine is very newbie and i learn some new stuff i want to use it and do it better.

I decided to create another small RPS game, with minimum of CSS and maximum of JavaScript, treat it like my entrance to the Object Oriented Programing in small steps.

I hope you will enjoy both of version of this old game :)
